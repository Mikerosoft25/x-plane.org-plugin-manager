# Deprecated Version of the X-Plane.org Plugin Manager

This directory contains the source code of version 2.0.4 of the X-Plane.org Plugin Manager.
Prior to version 3.0.0 the plugin manager was created with plain *HTML*, *CSS* and *JavaScript*.
These files are no longer needed due to the fact that the Plugin Manager now uses *React* and *TypeScript* for version 3.0.0 and above.
